I was messing with timers on my Arch system not long ago and thought it would be great if there was something to help manage these. I couldn't find anything so I wrote a bash script to do so.

I'd love any (constructive) feedback. I'm still newish to Linux and this is probably only my second bash script. So I'm still learning about best practices & whatnot.

I know this is still lacking when it comes to creating an associated service file, but I thought I'd get a base product out first & continue to work on it.

Would anyone even use this? I know timers aren't difficult to use. It's only a matter of creating one or two text files & enabling/starting them with systemctl. But I wanted to make something so people don't have to mess with the timer file syntax.

Let me know.
